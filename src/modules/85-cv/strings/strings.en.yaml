  contextualHelp:
    sli:
      intro: Metrics such as response time, error rate etc. are used to evaluate the performance of the monitored service.
      healthSource: A Health Source is a combination of a Harness Service and associated Environment that monitors changes in health trends of the service using logs or metrics collected from an Application Performance Management(APM) or logging provider.
      whatIsSli: What is an SLI?
      sliDefinition: An SLI (service level indicator) measures the performance of a service and compliance with an SLO (service level objective).
      sliDefinition2: So, if your SLA (Service Level Agreement) specifies that your systems will be available 99.9% of the time, your SLO should be set higher than 99.9%
      availabilityDescription: Measures how available your service was to users or valid requests served successfully.
      latencyDescription: Measures how fast your service responded to users or how many valid request served faster than a defined thresholds.
      thresholdDescription: The number of valid requests is compared to the length of time.
      ratioBasedDescription: Percentage of good requests that are acceptable.

    target:
      compliance: Compliance
      complianceDefinition: Compliance measures the current performance of the system and is measured against your SLO. There are two types of compliance periods for SLOs
      complianceDefinition2: Rolling periods (from n days ago to now, where n ranges from 1 to 30 days)
      complianceDefinition3: Calendar-based periods (from date to date)
      rollingWindowBased: Rolling window-based
      rollingWindowDefinition: Measures compliance over a rolling period, so that you are always evaluating, for example, the last 30 days. With a rolling period, the oldest data in the previous calculation drops out of the current calculation and new data replaces it.
      rollingWindowDefinition2: Rolling windows are more closely aligned with user experience
      calendarBased: Calendar-based
      calendarBasedDefinition: Compliance periods can be set to calendar periods like a weekly, monthly or quarterly. At the end of a calendar period, you are given a performance score. The performance score, which is calculated against the performance threshold, tells you whether your service was compliant or not. Even though you may view the performance throughout the period when you use a calendar period, you only get a compliance rating for every compliance period.
      calendarBasedDefinition2: Calendar windows are more closely aligned with business planning and project work.

The region between outermost circle and second circle is used for unknown logs seen in canary nodes while  the region between second circle and innermost circle is used for logs with unexpected frequency. The points that are related (logs observed in both canary and baseline nodes) will be shown on the same radii.The circle is divided into several sectors with each sector having several log messages. Use the slider to narrow down to the specific sector.
