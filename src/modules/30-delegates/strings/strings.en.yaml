  infoText: Harness Delegate is a service that can run in local network or VPC to connect artifact servers, infrastructure, collaboration, verification and other providers, with the Harness Manager. Harness provides different types of Delegates to give you flexibility in how you manage deployments. You can either deploy a kubernetes based delegate or a docker based delegate
  installDelegateSubText: Delegates are worker processes that run on your infrastructure to execute tasks on behalf of the Harness platform.
